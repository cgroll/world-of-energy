The subsequent supply cuts caused gas prices to surge\n5-fold, directly impacting electricity prices since gas plants often set the\nmarginal price.\n\nMerit order effect: In electricity markets, the most expensive plant\nneeded to meet demand sets the price for all generators. With gas prices\nsoaring, this “marginal” plant became extremely costly.\n\nThe crisis peaked in August 2022 when wholesale prices exceeded 850 EUR/MWh.","type":"content","url":"/#the-2021-2023-energy-crisis","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"DE/LU Electricity Prices Analysis","lvl3":"Negative Prices","lvl2":"Observations from the Data"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/#negative-prices","position":16},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"DE/LU Electricity Prices Analysis","lvl3":"Negative Prices","lvl2":"Observations from the Data"},"content":"The hourly data shows prices occasionally dropping below zero (visible as\ndownward spikes reaching -200 to -500 EUR/MWh). Negative prices mean\nproducers must pay to have their electricity taken off the grid.\n\nWhy this happens:\n\nRenewable oversupply: On sunny, windy days (especially weekends), solar\nand wind generation can exceed demand. Germany added massive renewable\ncapacity—the EU installed a record 56 GW of solar in 2023 alone.\n\nInflexible generation: Nuclear and some coal plants cannot quickly ramp\ndown, so they pay to keep running rather than face costly shutdown/restart.\n\nGrid congestion: Limited transmission capacity can trap excess power in\ncertain regions.\n\nTiming mismatch: Peak solar production (midday) doesn’t align with peak\ndemand (mornings/evenings), especially on low-demand weekends.\n\nIn H1 2025, Germany experienced 389 hours of negative day-ahead prices.","type":"content","url":"/#negative-prices","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"DE/LU Electricity Prices Analysis","lvl3":"Positive Price Spikes","lvl2":"Observations from the Data"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/#positive-price-spikes","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"DE/LU Electricity Prices Analysis","lvl3":"Positive Price Spikes","lvl2":"Observations from the Data"},"content":"Extreme upward spikes (600-900+ EUR/MWh) occur during supply scarcity events:\n\nDunkelflaute: German for “dark doldrums”—periods of cold, cloudy, windless\nweather when renewable output collapses.
