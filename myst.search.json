The subsequent supply cuts caused gas prices to surge\n5-fold, directly impacting electricity prices since gas plants often set the\nmarginal price.\n\nMerit order effect: In electricity markets, the most expensive plant\nneeded to meet demand sets the price for all generators.

Germany added massive renewable\ncapacity—the EU installed a record 56 GW of solar in 2023 alone.\n\nInflexible generation: Nuclear and some coal plants cannot quickly ramp\ndown, so they pay to keep running rather than face costly shutdown/restart.\n\nGrid congestion: Limited transmission capacity can trap excess power in\ncertain regions.\n\nTiming mismatch: Peak solar production (midday) doesn’t align with peak\ndemand (mornings/evenings), especially on low-demand weekends.\n\nIn H1 2025, Germany experienced 389 hours of negative day-ahead prices.","type":"content","url":"/notebooks/smard-de-prices#negative-prices","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"DE/LU Electricity Prices Analysis","lvl3":"Positive Price Spikes","lvl2":"Observations from the Data"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/notebooks/smard-de-prices#positive-price-spikes","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"DE/LU Electricity Prices Analysis","lvl3":"Positive Price Spikes","lvl2":"Observations from the Data"},"content":"Extreme upward spikes (600-900+ EUR/MWh) occur during supply scarcity events:\n\nDunkelflaute: German for “dark doldrums”—periods of cold, cloudy, windless\nweather when renewable output collapses.
