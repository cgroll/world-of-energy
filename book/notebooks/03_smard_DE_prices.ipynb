    "This notebook loads and visualizes day-ahead electricity prices for the\n",
    "German-Luxembourg market area from SMARD data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The **SMARD** platform (operated by the German Federal Network Agency,\n",
    "*Bundesnetzagentur*) is the primary hub for high-resolution electricity market\n",
    "data in Germany. It serves as a transparent \"scoreboard\" for the energy\n",
    "transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are SMARD Electricity Prices (DE/LU)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **DE/LU** price refers to the wholesale cost of electricity for the joint\n",
    "bidding zone comprising **Germany and Luxembourg**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniform Price:** Within this zone, electricity is treated as if it were on\n",
    "  a \"copper plate\"—the wholesale price is the same regardless of location.\n",
    "- **Wholesale vs. Retail:** These are *wholesale* prices (what energy suppliers\n",
    "  pay on the exchange). Retail bills include additional taxes, grid fees, and\n",
    "  levies.\n",
    "- **Volatility:** Prices fluctuate hourly based on weather (wind/solar), demand\n",
    "  (industrial activity), and fuel prices (natural gas).\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Day-Ahead?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Day-Ahead Market** is the primary exchange for electricity. Because\n",
    "electricity is difficult to store, it must be traded before production.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Auction:** Every day at **12:00 CET**, an auction takes place for each\n",
    "  hour of the *following* day.\n",
    "- **Clearing Price:** The exchange algorithm finds where supply meets demand.\n",
    "  This \"Market Clearing Price\" is what SMARD publishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connection to Other Bidding Zones\n",
    "\n",
    "Germany/Luxembourg is part of the **Single Day-Ahead Coupling (SDAC)**, linking\n",
    "most of Europe. Through interconnectors, electricity flows from low-price areas\n",
    "(high supply) to high-price areas (high demand). When cables are congested,\n",
    "prices \"split\" between zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Daylight Savings Time Transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Spring (23-hour day):** When clocks jump from 02:00 to 03:00, the 2 AM hour\n",
    "  is missing from the data.\n",
    "- **Autumn (25-hour day):** When clocks fall back, the extra hour is labeled\n",
    "  as **3A and 3B** (or similar). This often shows very low prices due to\n",
    "  reduced demand and extra generation capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations from the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 2021-2023 Energy Crisis\n",
    "\n",
    "The most striking feature in the data is the dramatic price surge from mid-2021\n",
    "through early 2023, with monthly averages peaking above **460 EUR/MWh** in\n",
    "August 2022—roughly 10x the pre-crisis baseline of ~40 EUR/MWh.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary causes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Post-COVID recovery (2021):** Economic rebound increased global energy\n",
    "  demand, particularly for LNG in Asia, tightening European gas supplies.\n",
    "- **Russia's invasion of Ukraine (Feb 2022):** Russia had supplied ~44% of\n",
    "  EU natural gas imports. The subsequent supply cuts caused gas prices to surge\n",
    "  5-fold, directly impacting electricity prices since gas plants often set the\n",
    "  marginal price.\n",
    "- **Merit order effect:** In electricity markets, the most expensive plant\n",
    "  needed to meet demand sets the price for all generators. With gas prices\n",
    "  soaring, this \"marginal\" plant became extremely costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The crisis peaked in **August 2022** when wholesale prices exceeded 850 EUR/MWh.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negative Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "The hourly data shows prices occasionally dropping below zero (visible as\n",
    "downward spikes reaching -200 to -500 EUR/MWh). **Negative prices** mean\n",
    "producers must *pay* to have their electricity taken off the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this happens:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Renewable oversupply:** On sunny, windy days (especially weekends), solar\n",
    "  and wind generation can exceed demand. Germany added massive renewable\n",
    "  capacity—the EU installed a record 56 GW of solar in 2023 alone.\n",
    "- **Inflexible generation:** Nuclear and some coal plants cannot quickly ramp\n",
    "  down, so they pay to keep running rather than face costly shutdown/restart.\n",
    "- **Grid congestion:** Limited transmission capacity can trap excess power in\n",
    "  certain regions.\n",
    "- **Timing mismatch:** Peak solar production (midday) doesn't align with peak\n",
    "  demand (mornings/evenings), especially on low-demand weekends.\n",
    "\n",
    "In H1 2025, Germany experienced **389 hours** of negative day-ahead prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positive Price Spikes\n",
    "\n",
    "Extreme upward spikes (600-900+ EUR/MWh) occur during supply scarcity events:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dunkelflaute:** German for \"dark doldrums\"—periods of cold, cloudy, windless\n",
    "  weather when renewable output collapses. In December 2024, intraday prices\n",
    "  briefly hit ~1,000 EUR/MWh during an extended Dunkelflaute.\n",
    "- **Plant outages:** Unplanned maintenance or failures of conventional plants\n",
    "  during high-demand periods exacerbate scarcity.\n",
    "- **Peak demand:** Cold winter evenings with high heating demand and low\n",
    "  renewable output force reliance on expensive gas \"peaker\" plants.\n",
    "\n",
    "These dynamics illustrate why **flexibility** (storage, demand response, grid\n",
    "expansion) is critical for integrating high shares of variable renewables."
